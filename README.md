# ROBOT MOTION ENGINE

The Robot Motion Engine is a software framework for managing, planning, and controlling robot motion.
It provides a modular architecture that separates robot management, motion planning, scheduling, and control.

## Classes

### RobotManager

The `RobotManager` class is responsible for initializing and managing robot instances based on configuration files.
It serves as the entry point for setting up and running robot motion.

- **load**
    : Reads a `YAML` configuration file and maps its contents to a custom configuration structure.
      This configuration typically includes DH parameters, limits and motion options.

- **start**
    : Starts the robot motion system.
      If the robot is not located at the home position, it first moves the robot to the home position before executing any motion.

- **stop**
    : Stops the robot motion safely and commands the robot to return to the home position.

### RobotController

The `RobotController` class controls a single robot to execute motions generated by the planner.
Also It has a scheduler to manage states and a controller to compute control inputs.

- **load**
    : Initializes robot parameters and determines the types of the scheduler, planner, and controller.

- **home**
    : Moves the robot to its predefined home position.

- **start**
    : Begins executing motion commands provided by the controller until a stop command is pubished.

- **stop**
    : Stops motion execution and safely halts the robot.

### Scheduler

The `Scheduer` class manages a sequence of robot actions.
Each action is represnted as a state, following the concept of a FSM (Finite State Machine).
The scheduler determines which state is active and when transitions between states occur.

- **reset**
    : Resets the scheduler to its initial state.

- **tick**
    : Updates the current state of the FSM and triggers state transition based on predefined conditions.

### Planner

The `Planner` class generates motions or paths required for each scheduler state.
It computes desired trajectories in task space or joint space.

- **reset**
    : Resets the planner's internal state and clears previously generated plans.

- **eval**
    : Evaluates and generates a motion or trajectory for the current state.

### Controller

The `Controller` class computes control input to track the desired trajectory generated by the planner.

- **reset**
    : Resets the controller's interal variables.

- **compute**
    : Computes control inputs (e.g., torques, velocities, or position commands) to follow the desired trajectory.
